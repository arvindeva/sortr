- Organize items into groups for better categorization and filtering
- Select specific groups to include in sorting sessions
- Rank items using merge sort, UI with progress tracking
- Undo recent sorting decisions (last 1 states)
- Save progress locally without account requirement using localStorage
- Login with email to create, save, and manage personal sorters
- Share ranking pages with ranked outcomes and downloadable images
- Download ranking images as PNG with neobrutalism design
- Upload and manage personal avatars with automatic image processing
- View and track completion/view counts for public sorters

### Code Conventions

- Uses TypeScript with strict mode
- Path aliases configured: `@/*` maps to `./src/*`
- shadcn/ui component aliases: `@/components`, `@/lib/utils`, `@/components/ui`
- Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- Lucide React for icons
- clsx + tailwind-merge utility pattern for conditional classes
- **Data Fetching**: Use TanStack Query instead of useEffect for API calls when possible
- **State Management**: Prefer TanStack Query for server state, React state for UI state
- **Design System**: Use neobrutalism.dev components with automatic retro styling (see Design System section)

- **Button Position Updates**: Standardized action button order across sorter and rankings pages - "Sort This/Sort Now" on left, "Share" on right, with responsive layouts (desktop: integrated in header, mobile: separate section below).

## Image Upload System (Avatars & Cover Images)

### Technical Stack

- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 with S3-compatible API for scalable object storage
- **Image Processing**: Sharp library for server-side image manipulation
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for optimistic updates and cache management
- **File Validation**: Client and server-side validation for security and UX

### Image Processing Pipeline

1. **Client Upload**: File selection with immediate validation (type, size)
2. **Server Processing**: Sharp-based center crop and resize to specified pixels (200x200 for avatars, cover images as configured)
3. **R2 Storage**: Upload to Cloudflare R2 with unique user-based or sorter-based keys
4. **Cache-Busting**: Generate timestamp query parameter to prevent cache issues
5. **Database Update**: Database updated with public image URL including cache-busting timestamp

### Security & Validation

- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js session validation on all endpoints
- **File Type Validation**: MIME type checking (client and server)
- **Size Limits**: 1MB enforced on both client and server
- **Image Validation**: Sharp-based format verification prevents malicious uploads
- **Access Control**: Users can only manage their own avatars and sorter cover images

### Performance Optimizations

- **Client-Side State**: TanStack Query provides optimistic updates
- **Image Preloading**: Automatic preload on URL changes for smooth UX
- **Cache Management**: R2 public URLs with timestamp cache-busting for both avatars and cover images to prevent stale cache issues
- **Shimmer Loading**: CSS-based animation reduces perceived loading time
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallback to initial letter avatars
- **CDN Cache Prevention**: Timestamp query parameters ensure immediate display of updated images

## Design System

### Neobrutalism.dev Components

The application uses the neobrutalism.dev component library, which provides shadcn/ui components with automatic retro/neobrutalism styling via CSS variables. This approach eliminates the need for manual component retrofitting and provides consistent styling across the entire application.

### Design Philosophy

All components follow the neobrutalism aesthetic principles:

- **Consistent Borders**: All components use 2px borders with black (light) / white (dark) colors (`border-2 border-border`)
- **Dramatic Shadows**: Bold drop shadows for depth and retro aesthetic (`shadow-shadow`)
- **Poppins Font**: Modern geometric font for readability and retro feel
- **CSS Variables**: Centralized styling configuration in `/src/app/globals.css`

### Component Installation

**IMPORTANT**: Always use neobrutalism.dev components when available instead of creating custom implementations.

Components are installed from the neobrutalism.dev registry:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://neobrutalism.dev/r/button.json
```

Before implementing any UI component, check if it exists at https://neobrutalism.dev/components/ and use the official version with the installation command above. Only create custom implementations if the component doesn't exist on neobrutalism.dev.

### Core Components

### CSS Variables

All styling is controlled via CSS variables in `/src/app/globals.css`:

- **Colors**: `--main`, `--background`, `--foreground`, `--border`, etc.
- **Shadows**: `--shadow: 2px 2px 0px 0px var(--border)`
- **Spacing**: `--spacing-boxShadowX`, `--spacing-boxShadowY`, `--spacing-reverseBoxShadowX`, `--spacing-reverseBoxShadowY`
- **Borders**: `--radius-base: 10px`
- **Fonts**: `--font-weight-base: 500`, `--font-weight-heading: 800`

### Usage Guidelines

1. **Use Button for all interactive elements** (buttons, clickable items, form controls)
2. **Use Card for content containers** (listings, summaries, content blocks)
3. **Use Badge for small labels** (categories, status indicators, tags)
4. **Use Box for static highlights** (hero sections, headers, callouts)
5. **Use Logo for special interactive branding** (logos, headers)

### Implementation Notes

- Components maintain standard shadcn/ui APIs for easy migration
- Press animation is built into components via neobrutalism classes
- Border thickness is standardized to 2px across all components
- Shadow values are controlled via CSS variables for consistency
- Components use `cva` (class-variance-authority) for type-safe variants
- Full dark mode support is built into all components via CSS variables
- No manual component retrofitting needed - styling is automatic via CSS variables
